    <p1><br> Being born on 18th  of July 1918, Nelson has been a great black nationalist leader.</p1></br>
    <p2>He entered politics from 1942 whereby he fought for the rights and freedom of South African Nationalists. he was a person of interest on my end because this great man has done alot and has undergone torture and racism but due to his firmness, the great legend, Mandela, led South Afria to its Independence.</p>
<p3><br>"I have fought against white domination and I have fought against Black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a free  and democratic society in which all persons live in harmony and with equal right opportunities. Its an ideal which i hope to achieve, but if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die." Nelson Mandela's own words before being imprisoned. Being a legend, his people aided in fighting for his independence leading to his release in 1990.
</p3></br>
<p4><br> He voted for the first time in South Africa in 1994 and won the elections being the first ever elected democratic president in South Africa.
</p4></br>
<p5> Later, he died on December 2013. He really was a great figure of a leader to all other African leaders and this made many African Nations to be able to attain their independence.</p5>
